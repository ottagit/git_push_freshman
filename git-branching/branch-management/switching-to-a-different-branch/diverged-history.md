When you make a few more changes and commit

`vim test.rb`

`git commit -am 'make more changes'`

your project history diverges as shown in the diagram below

             _**Diverged branch histories**_



**Your workflow:**

You created a new branch _testing, _switched to and did some work on it, and then switched back to your main branch _master _and did some other work. 

**NB: **Both of these changes are isolated in separate branches: once ready with work on either branches, you can switch back and forth between the branches and merge them together.
